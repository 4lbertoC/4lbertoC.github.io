          <p>Expeditions take place in a land. There is a card for each land. The icon clusters on the edges of the land card represents the possible outcomes of a single expedition.</p>

        <div class="tutorial-page"><p>Some symbols represent the reagents that the adventurers can find. There are two kinds of reagents: oddities and mementos. You need reagents to study the domains of magic.</p>

            You can read more about adventurer skills in the Appendix of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cJ71huA_q9MuMFZ9O58aKzP4WIhteUizobMLmSaxNA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">game manual</a>.

        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            There are three types of adventurers: collectors (red), defenders (blue) and strategists (yellow). An expedition party is made of three adventurers, one per type.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            Land and adventurer cards are placed in a row on the expedition board. For each of the cards you are going to draw a result card.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            Result cards are placed below the land and adventurer cards, and indicate the outcome of that specific card for the current expedition.
          </p>
          <p>Result cards have a fixed rule: the outcome on the left has high chance of showing up, the outcome on the right has medium chance and the middle has low chance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            These are the basic concepts. Let's have a look at the steps of an expedition.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            First of all, you have to pick a land card. There are four in total in the game.  Let's assume that the "Mystical Forest" is the land that you want to use now. Once you have chosen the land, you can orient it in the direction that you prefer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try this now. Hover on the land card, you will see the controls. Once you are satisfied, click "Next".
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            Once you've done that, choose the order of your adventurers. Hover on the adventurer cards to move them around. The order of the adventurer cards is important because this determines which adventurer gets wounded based on the land outcome.
          </p>
          <p>For example, if the land's result card points at the outcome on the left and this land outcome contains a wound, the adventurer on the left will get wounded. Only the outcome that the result card points at counts for wounds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            It's time to draw a result for the land card. The outcome that the card points at is the one on the bottom-left. At this point it's not possible to rotate the land anymore.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            Now that we know what the adventurers are going to face, it's their time to get the most out of the expedition. You cannot swap the adventurers anymore, but you can rotate them in the orientation that you prefer, so that the side that you want to use is at the bottom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go on and rotate the adventurers now!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            The final step is the resolution of the adventurer cards. Draw a result card for each adventurer, but don't place them as close as you put it to the land. Result cards for adventurers come into play in "pending" mode. You are going to decide in which order you want to resolve them. This is important because adventurers can affect the outcome of their companions!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            Here you can see that result cards can also have modifiers. Some modifiers require you to rotate the adventurer or land card, or allow you to draw an inspiration card.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            One by one, resolve the result cards in the order you prefer. For example, I decide to start from the adventurer in the rightmost position. As indicated by the result card, I have to rotate the card by 90 degrees clockwise.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            Then I resolve the adventurer in the leftmost position. I have to rotate this card by 180 degrees.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            And finally the adventurer in the middle position. This adventurer will additionally earn an inspiration card.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-page">
          <p>
            And this is the expedition phase! Experiment a bit with rotations and positions, and look up in the manual the meanings of the adventurer skills.
